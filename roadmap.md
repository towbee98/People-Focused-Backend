# üõ†Ô∏è People-Focused Job Board ‚Äì Roadmap

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for evolving this Job Board project into a **robust, scalable, AI-powered platform** while serving as a personal learning journey in **React, Microservices, and AI Integration**.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 0: Foundation Setup (Current Phase)
- [ ] Review and refactor the existing ExpressJS backend.
- [ ] Clean up project structure, add ESLint + Prettier.
- [ ] Add `.env.example` and update **README.md**.
- [ ] Set up GitHub project board + issues for task tracking.
- [ ] Configure Docker (`Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml`) for backend + database.
- [ ] Introduce database migrations + seeding (Prisma/TypeORM or migrate-mongo).
- [ ] Add Jest + Supertest for basic API testing.
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for CI (tests on push).
- [ ] Gather Figma templates for UI inspiration, build wireframes.
- [ ] Write this `ROADMAP.md`.

---

## üöÄ Phase 1: Core Backend Improvements
- [ ] Modularize codebase into services (auth, jobs, applications).
- [ ] Add JWT authentication + role-based access control (admin, recruiter, candidate).
- [ ] Implement pagination + filtering for job listings.
- [ ] Add rate-limiting + request validation middleware.
- [ ] Improve error handling with a global error handler.
- [ ] Strengthen logging (Winston, Morgan).
- [ ] Expand test coverage with unit + integration tests.

---

## üé® Phase 2: Frontend with React
- [ ] Bootstrap frontend with React + TypeScript + Vite.
- [ ] Set up routing (React Router).
- [ ] Build UI screens:
  - Job Listings (browse, filter, search).
  - Job Details (apply, save).
  - Recruiter Dashboard (post/manage jobs, view applicants).
  - Candidate Profile (resume, skills, saved jobs).
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend via REST APIs.
- [ ] Add authentication flow (login, register, JWT handling).
- [ ] Style with TailwindCSS (consider shadcn/ui or Material UI).
- [ ] Deploy frontend + backend together (Netlify/Vercel + Render/DigitalOcean).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 3: Microservices Transition
- [ ] Break backend into separate services:
  - Auth Service
  - Job Service
  - Application Service
  - Notification Service
- [ ] Introduce API Gateway (e.g., Express Gateway or custom).
- [ ] Use message broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka/Redis Streams) for async communication.
- [ ] Implement centralized logging + monitoring (ELK stack, Grafana).
- [ ] Containerize each service with Docker + orchestrate with Docker Compose.
- [ ] Later: Explore Kubernetes for scaling.

---

## ü§ñ Phase 4: AI-Powered Features
- [ ] Resume Parsing Service (extract skills, experience).
- [ ] AI Job Matching:
  - Calculate % fit between resumes and job descriptions.
  - Recommend best-fit jobs to candidates.
- [ ] **Career Path Navigator** (unique feature):
  - Analyze user skills vs. desired role.
  - Suggest learning roadmap + future job matches.
- [ ] AI-Powered Job Description Generator (help recruiters draft better postings).
- [ ] Experiment with embeddings + OpenAI API for semantic search.

---

## üåç Phase 5: Polish & Advanced Features
- [ ] Add user notifications (email + in-app).
- [ ] Recruiter analytics dashboard (views, applicants, trends).
- [ ] Candidate progress tracking (applications, responses).
- [ ] Payment integration (Stripe) for premium recruiter plans.
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native) for job seekers.
- [ ] Deploy microservices on cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipelines for automatic deployment.
- [ ] Prepare portfolio write-up + case study of this project.

---

## üéØ End Goal
By the end of this roadmap, this project will be:
- A **production-grade job board** with modern frontend + scalable backend.
- A **personal learning showcase** for:
  - ExpressJS ‚Üí Microservices
  - React + TypeScript
  - Docker, CI/CD, Cloud Deployments
  - AI integrations (LLMs, embeddings, semantic search)

This project will serve as a **portfolio highlight** to demonstrate backend expertise, frontend capability, and AI innovation.
